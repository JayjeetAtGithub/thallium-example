1. Exposing empty buffer takes ~10ms while exposing filled buffer takes ~1.2ms

2. server, client 
    me, me: 1780ms (client expose costs)
    me, se: 740ms (none)
    se, me: 2840ms (memcpy costs and client expose)
    se, se: 1810ms (memcpy costs)

3. exposing write buffer > exposing r/w buffer > exposing read buffer

4. Can't work with so many round trips, basically O(n) where n is the number of batches.
